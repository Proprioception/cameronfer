        <p>I started walking the path of teaching when I was fifteen and under the advisement of my principal, I decided to become a student-teacher for a design class. The teacher of this design class would observe me helping other students and told me that I had a 'good knack' for what it takes to teach others. Though I had never really seen myself as a teacher when I was younger, I had to admit that the role did suit me to a degree. I would work with youth from India to Nunavut and found that making connections and having teachable moments was something that happened consistently. <br><br>Outside of relationship building - whose importance cannot be overestimated - I also found that I enjoyed the process of self-study, formatting content to specific needs, and teaching too those needs. There is something about teaching that if you can tap into, which is that there is no more natural act than to bring up the next generation, then the process of learning, growing, and changing can become more effective for student and teacher alike. Considering procesesses and their importance, I attached some mixed media on my home page since I believe someone's creative work can at times act as a mirror for how they see the world around them.</p>
