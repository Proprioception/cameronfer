	<h3 id="alookie_page_link" class="col-12">Alookie Elementary School</h3>
	<p class="col-12">Located in one of Canada's three territories, I travelled to Alookie elementary in Pangnirtung, Nunavut in late 2019. The school had, on average, 168 students and around 12 staff. I was filling the position of being an English instructor responsible for ESL instruction and English as a Language Arts. My responsibilities involved benchmarking students from grades 3 to 5 using the Fountas and Pinnell system of assessment and provided resources. The official language of the community was Inuktitut, and students grew up speaking with their elders in their ancestral language. The community itself is well-known within Nunavut for the language proficiency of its residents.<br><br>

	I worked from kindergarten to grade 4 teaching multiple classes along differentiated lines of instructional difficulty. I focused on using technology and games as a means of internalizing information in students; this form of teaching was informed by such ideas as expressed by Ludic language pedagogy. This focus is less on prescriptive memorization but instead on the use of language in practical contexts so that meaning could be more easily derived by ways of observation and use. Tying in cultural elements was also an essential step in forming connections.<br><br>

	The community was as such that you couldn't walk the ten-minute distance from your home to the grocery store without having at least one or three conversations with various people. There was always a healthy population of kids enjoying the fresh air, and they never failed to carry the excitement for an interaction with them. I would often have kids knocking on my door inquiring if perhaps I had purchased one too many apples for myself, and if it would perhaps be best for me to relinquish some. This would then be followed by waking up to some arctic char or seal fins tied to your doorknob in the morning.<br><br>

	My time in Pangnirtung was one that branched the whole spectrum of emotional possibility, and I am grateful for that and to the community for hosting me until 2021.

		<h3 id="miyazaki_page_link" class="col-12">Miyazaki City</h3>
		<p class="col-12">I would live and work for a year in the prefecture of Miyazaki, Japan in 2017. I worked for Miyazaki city, and would alternate between multiple elementary and middle schools where I would teach ESL from kindergarten to grade 9. When I wasn't at work, I would alternate between learning Kyudo from my sensei grandmother and surfing the Pacific with other like-minded folks. There were multiple opportunities to gain a better cultural understanding of Southern Japan through travel; steam covered onsen towns smelling of sulphur with teal water; forested paths thick with cicada cries that loop around a resting volcano; happiness shared through mutual moments of food and drink in celebration of blossoms and fireworks.<br><br>

		Working in Japan involved focusing on the curriculum as the ultimate guide to every activity and though this could be limiting at times, it did make lessons more consistent and succinct. I would create games as a means of communication with a lot of physical props to help bridge the language gap. I found that focusing on making lessons interactive and engaging was a surer means of reaching the larger class size considering most classes averaged 35 students. There were moments like catching a high-five and a quick hello in the hallway, to working together during cleaning duty that made my time in Japan meaningful through the small things done consistently. It was this consistency that seemed to make the culture and society of Japan function with this communal spirit of well-reflected growth, even during times of tragedy and loss.<br><br>

		Japan was another chapter of my life in working to understand not only the world around me but myself within it.

		<p class="col-12">During my time getting my education degree, I spent my last practicum in late 2016 in the town of Queen Charlotte. I stayed with a local family and taught at the Gidgalang Kuuyas Naay Secondary School. I would teach socials 8, English First Peoples 10, and Geography 12. I found my time was spent between classes that could range from fifteen to four students and exploring the culture and nature of the community around me. I spent a considerable amount of time at the Haida Gwaii Museum learning about the history of the geology of the islands from a time before Western red cedars and the coming of what would be known as the Haida during the final years of the ice age. I would work to incorporate the cultural history around me and use what I had learned in a teachable manner.<br><br>

		Haida Gwaii and the people that live there are truly unique and represent a special part of West coast history and I felt fortunate to have been a part of it for the two months I spent there.

		<h3 id="kwalikum_page_link" class="col-12">Kwalikum Secondary</h3>
		<p class="col-12">I would teach social studies at Kwalikum Secondary in 2015, and under the supervision of a combined experience of over forty years, I learned the finer points of teaching. My supervisor and sponsor teacher were both constructive and model examples of the pedagogical craft, and I learned from them the importance of contextual organization and efficient planning. I worked with the students in creating larger projects for summative assessment criteria that involved presentations on historical leaders or events. I also worked on crafting formative assessment standards with my mentors’ words constantly echoing, "assessment first."<br><br>

		I have worked to make this a cornerstone of my teaching in that I work from a defined goal with clearly outlined expectations and then work on the details of how to get there. I would learn a remarkable amount from my time at this school and found there a community of like-minded professionals who daily excelled at meeting their students needs.
